Changelog
============

2.0.0a1
----------
This is the first alpha release. It is very much a work in progress.

These are the main differences from the MFL version 1 implementation:

 * entities with `name` fields will have only that one name. In the previous implementation, there were `displayName` and `shortName` fields
 * all non-core functionality e.g email newsletters, blogging was removed
